                    My name is Erik Garcia. I am a rising senior at Marble Hill High School for International Studies. I was born and raised in New York City. I am passionate about computer science and business, with a goal to study at Fordham University or NYU. Many people describe me as a hardworking and dedicated person. My biggest goals are to attend Fordham University where I can pursue a degree in tech and business. A short-term goal for me is to take the SAT once more for a chance to achieve a score of 1450 or higher.<br><br>
                    
                    I'm actively involved in my school community, participating in the chess club and tech club. These activities have helped me improve my skills in teamwork, communication, and idea exchange. Outside of school, I enjoy playing soccer with my friends, playing chess, and occasionally playing video games. As of right now, I mostly play EA FC 24. I'm also involved in various programs outside of school. One of them is Opportunity Network, which aims to prepare high school students for professional settings through workshops on networking and etiquette skills. All Star Code is another program that has helped me develop web development skills through programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. "Your past does not equal your future." This quote by Tony Robbins resonates with me because it reminds me not to give up, regardless of past outcomes.
